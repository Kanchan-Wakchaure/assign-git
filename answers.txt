• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ans: If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore that includes file 
     extensions, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, 
     before you make a commit. A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to 
     share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.
     
     For a Java project, gitignore file should include file extensions such as .class, .log, .jar, .war, 
     .rar, .ear, .zip, .ctxt etc   

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Ans: Fast-forward means you merge a branch that is ahead of your checked-out branch.
     It is a direct merging used if two branches have same commit path.

• Why should you have different branches?
Ans: When multiple people are working on same code, conflicts could be created by overriding the code in same branch.
     To avoid mess up in master branch code and keep it clean, we should use different branches.
     If a user wants to add or modify some changes in code, he/she can create a new branch and put the changes in that branch.
     Later if all code works fine, then branch code can be merged into master branch. 

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ans: You can have multiple remote respositories in your project. Though you have one as a default remote repository in Git 
     which is called "origin".
